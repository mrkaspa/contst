{-| The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access
tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.
Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
from the authorization server.

This is a 3-step process:

  - The client asks for an authorization to the OAuth provider: the user is redirected.
  - The provider redirects the user back and the client parses the request query parameters from the url.
  - The client authenticate itself using the authorization code found in the previous step.

After those steps, the client owns an `access_token` that can be used to authorize any subsequent
request.
